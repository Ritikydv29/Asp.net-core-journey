# ConsoleToAPI

This is my dedicated project for daily learning of **ASP.NET Core Web API**.

Each day, I add new concepts, controllers, models, and features to explore and understand how ASP.NET Core Web API works from the ground up.

## 📌 Project Purpose

To document and practice building real-world REST APIs using:
- ASP.NET Core (.NET 8)
- Visual Studio / VS Code
- SQL Server (optional)
- Entity Framework Core (in progress)
